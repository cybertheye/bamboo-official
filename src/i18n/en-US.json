For a long time, the company has devoted itself to research, with more professional technology, greater investment and continuous innovation to face the market competition. The company has always adhered to the \"quality of survival, science and technology and development\" business policy, the integrity of the business philosophy is the goal of Mottled electromechanical, the company developed a fuel-saving bearing box won the utility model patent certificate.

The technology is to change the structure of the box (add steps at the bottom of the box to lock the filled oil near the bearings at both ends; At the same time, increase the oil injection hole and move its position to both ends) to achieve the purpose of reducing the oil use and the oil injection time, and ultimately it is expected to reduce the oil use by 50% and the oil injection time by 75%."
