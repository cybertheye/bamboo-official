Why Did We Name Our Company "Banbo" 

This question has been asked quite frequently, so let's officially address it this time. What I'm about to present is probably a concept that you haven't consciously noticed but has long existed, so you need to set aside the common understanding that first comes to mind when you see the word "Banbo".

## "Bo", Taking Its Noun Meaning

This character is considered the simplified form of "駮". Baidu provides the following evolution of the character:

In the "Classic of Mountains and Seas", "駮" is described as: "There is a beast, its form is like a horse with a white body and black tail, one horn, tiger teeth and claws, its sound is like a drum, its name is Bo, it eats tigers and leopards, and can be used to defend against armies." (Western Mountains Classic, Fourth Western Classic). So "Bo" is actually a unicorn-like horse that stands at the top of the food chain (which is why I used "unicorn" instead of "bamboo" when translating the company's English name).

## "Ban", Taking Its Adjectival Meaning

But the "Ban" here is not the innate pattern, but in an abstract sense, the marks left on the body and mind by time and environment after entering the world. All of you who strive to survive and live better cannot always remain untainted in body and mind, and those spots and marks are evidence of our journey of struggle.

"Banbo" is actually not the commonly used adjective, but a noun. Its implication is the hope that the company can become a unicorn that does not fear tigers and leopards (competitors) and keeps moving forward!
