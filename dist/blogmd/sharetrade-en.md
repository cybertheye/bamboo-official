This article shares the experience of a recent foreign trade order, which represents our ability to serve a wider range of customers and officially enter the international stage.

As the opening piece of this series, we aim to describe the framework of the foreign trade process as much as possible, without delving into too many details to avoid excessive length. In the future, we will select specific aspects for detailed discussion based on feedback and operational arrangements.

Special thanks to: Lucy for her patient guidance throughout the process, truly imparting knowledge and resolving doubts, which has been immensely beneficial to me.

First, let's take a look at a sequence diagram to get an overview of our order process:

![Foreign Trade Order Sequence Diagram](/images/blog/trade1.png)

# Order Background

Customer V wanted to purchase a batch of fan bearing housings from the manufacturer. After initial technical communication and list confirmation, both parties had clarified the product drawings and technical details, and the quotation was basically completed. The customer requested to trade at FOB price and required a Certificate of Origin (C/O).

> FOB (Free on Board) is a common term in international trade, indicating that the buyer assumes all risks and costs after the goods are loaded onto the ship. In practice, the FOB price should include the ex-factory price, trucking fees, and fees for the customer's designated freight forwarder.
> 
> The Certificate of Origin (C/O) is one of the important documents required for export. After the import and export rights are approved, it can be applied for through the "China International Trade Single Window". This process will be introduced later.

# Obtaining Foreign Trade Qualifications and Receiving Payment

First, **foreign trade qualifications are the foundation for conducting foreign trade business. Since our company's business license already includes the phrase "import and export of goods", if not, the business scope needs to be changed**. The next step is to register with customs. This part can be done by yourself, but to save time and effort, it can also be handled by a third-party agent.

Additionally, a corporate foreign exchange account is needed. This requires having applied for import and export rights first, then going to the bank to process it, providing the required documents (the **most important being proof of import and export registration**). If you need to receive the customer's advance payment promptly and considering time constraints, **you can apply for Alibaba International's collection account to receive foreign exchange**. This doesn't require opening a store on Alibaba International, thus avoiding the time needed to apply for a corporate foreign exchange account.

At this point, the advance payment is successfully received, the production plan is ready, and the order enters the production stage.

# Preparation of Goods and Container Loading

After finalizing the production process, the factory worked overtime to complete the preparation of goods to ensure that customers could receive the goods as soon as possible. Upon receiving photos of the prepared goods, the customer quickly paid the balance, and we entered the container loading stage. Due to lack of experience in container loading, we used CAD software to simulate the packing of goods, ensuring that boxes of different sizes could be reasonably arranged in the container.

The next steps include providing customs declaration documents and authorizing the freight forwarder to handle customs clearance. This part involves numerous documents and materials, which we will elaborate on in the future.

At this point, we completed the container loading and successfully cleared customs.

# C/O Application

This part actually depends on the customer's needs; some require it, some don't. The application for a Certificate of Origin is a relatively complex process. After submitting the application through the ["China International Trade Single Window"](https://www.singlewindow.cn/#/), we encountered multiple rejections, usually due to improper form filling or information discrepancies.

The review process there has strict requirements. For example, one rejection was because the HS code was not on a new line when filling in the goods description.

After multiple revisions, the Certificate of Origin application was finally approved. **Additionally, before submission, it's advisable to communicate with the customer about any necessary changes. For instance, in this case, after experiencing three days of multiple application rejections and modifications, and finally succeeding, the customer added port information details and changed the goods description, resulting in us having to reapply.**

> Our fan bearing housing's HS code is 8483200000.
> The official definition is: Bearing housing with ball or roller bearings.
> It belongs to the category: Transmission shafts (including cam shafts and crank shafts) and cranks; bearing housings and plain shaft bearings; gears and gearing; ball or roller screws; gear boxes and other speed changers, including torque converters; flywheels and pulleys, including pulley blocks; clutches and shaft couplings (including universal joints):


# Customer Receipt of Goods

On the premise of receiving full payment, when the ship arrives at the port, the current practice is to use telex release to confirm the release of goods. However, this part is the responsibility of the designated freight forwarder, and they will naturally inquire about it.

> Telex Release: Also known as electronic release. It involves sending bill of lading information to the destination port shipping company via electronic message or information. The consignee can exchange documents and collect goods with the telex released bill of lading stamped with the telex release seal and the telex release guarantee. It refers to a bill of lading issued by the shipping company or its agent marked with "Surrendered, Telex Release".

As the customer shared photos of receiving the goods on social media, the order process officially concluded. Through this foreign trade order operation, we not only successfully completed our first foreign trade order but also accumulated valuable foreign trade experience in practical operations.
