Let me elaborate on three aspects: quality, appearance, and service:

# Quality is the Core

> "Prevent after-sales repairs by anticipating and addressing potential issues in advance."

As the core transmission component of C-type and D-type centrifugal fans, if a bearing box encounters problems, it not only involves significant repair costs but also seriously impacts product quality. Therefore, we adopt a "prevention-first" approach to potential after-sales repair issues.

Based on our production experience and customer feedback, we have summarized two main categories of problems that bearing boxes tend to develop after being put into use: noise and leakage. The causes of these two issues are multifaceted, and consequently, the corresponding solutions vary. It's difficult to explain thoroughly in just a few words, so I will prepare a separate article later, mainly discussing the causes of abnormal noise, oil leakage, and water leakage, as well as how we prevent these issues through our manufacturing processes. Below is an image of substandard semi-finished products:

**In short, we ensure our quality has quality!**

# Appearance

> "We regularly update and iterate our product appearance. Aesthetic trends are cyclical, from simple to ornate and back to simplicity, but change is constant."

Building upon the simple appearance long used by our predecessors, we have added distinctive design elements and then applied them across our product family:
1. Three reinforcing ribs on the shell, both aesthetically pleasing and sturdy
2. Three reinforcing ribs on the end cap, similarly attractive and robust
3. Heat dissipation patterns on the bearing positions of the oil-cooled series, both beautiful and functional

(A new water-cooled appearance is currently in the conceptual stage, coming soon~)

**In short, we ensure our aesthetics have aesthetics!**

> Additionally, I'd like to elaborate on the design meaning of our own logo: on one hand, it corresponds to the product, representing a top view of the bearing box assembly; on the other hand, it relates to the individual: it's a side view of a four-legged square "ding" (ancient Chinese vessel)
