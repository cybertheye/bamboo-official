# Shipping Issues

## Transport Mode: Shipment By Sea

<strong>Recently, most of the logistics quotes we received only cover delivery to the port, with only one or two offering door-to-door delivery service.</strong>

## Estimated Time of Departure

Because we are approaching the Chinese New Year, and the workers will be  all on holiday this weekend , so the shipment will be at the end of February.

## Incoterms Overview

## Solution A: CIF

We will cover the cost of Sea freight, *but you will need to handle the unloading at the port, customs clearance, payment of duties, and pick-up of the goods on your own.*

## Solution B: DDP

*The cost will be : 1080$*

<strong>Plz note: this logistics quote will change when the day goods shipping</strong>

## Solution C: Find yourself a freight forwarder agent in China

Then we will just deliver the goods to your agent in China. We will cover the cost of inland transit.
