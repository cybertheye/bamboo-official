Here we provide answers to frequently asked questions from our customers.

(Of course, if you have any questions not mentioned here, please feel free to ask in the comments section, and we will answer them one by one.)

Q1: Is this a complete assembly? Can the housing be sold separately?

A1: Yes, currently we mainly produce complete bearing housings including shafts and bearings. Of course, we also sell housings separately, but we prefer to sell complete sets because the assembly of bearing housings is also an important part of the process.

---

Q2: What kind of bearings do you use?

A2: Our standard configuration uses Wafangdian bearings. If you have specific brand requirements, please let us know, and we will reassess the pricing based on the actual situation.

---

Q3: What is the material of the main shaft?

A3: The standard material for the main shaft is 45# steel. If you have specific material requirements, please let us know, and we will provide a new quote.

---

Q4: Can the main shaft be heat-treated?

A4: Yes, it can be, but it will incur additional costs and extend the delivery time.

---

Q5: Can the main shaft dimensions be customized?

A5: Yes, they can be customized. We can discuss the specific requirements further. The price will increase appropriately based on the materials used, and the final production will be based on the approved drawings.

---

Q6: Can the housing dimensions be customized?

A6: The housing is a cast part and does not support dimensional customization. If the order quantity is substantial, we can consider customizing the mold, but this involves a series of issues such as long production cycles and mold costs, which need to be discussed in detail.

---

Q7: Is there a minimum order quantity for printing on the housing? Is there an additional cost?

A7: Currently, this service is provided free of charge only to long-term customers as a way of showing appreciation for their loyalty.

---

Q8: Can the surface paint color be customized?

A8: The standard configuration only includes anti-rust primer.

---

Q9: Is it possible to apply only the topcoat?

A9: It can be done, but we don't recommend it. If you only apply the topcoat without the anti-rust primer, rust spots will appear after prolonged outdoor use.

---

Q10: Does the quoted price include tax and shipping?

A10: The price includes tax. As for shipping costs, they need to be estimated based on the delivery location. Generally, the shipping cost is calculated for delivery to a freight station for self-pickup. If door-to-door delivery is required, please inform us in advance.

Q11: How long is the warranty period?

A11: Under normal circumstances, it follows the fan warranty, which is one year.
