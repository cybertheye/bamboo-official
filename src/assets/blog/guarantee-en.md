This article will introduce the common problems that may occur during the use of bearing housings and the preventive measures we have taken.

As mentioned before, the problems with bearing housings can be summarized as "noise" and "leakage":

- "Noise" basically refers to abnormal bearing sounds
- "Leakage" can be further divided into "water leakage" and "oil leakage"

Let's discuss these three aspects in detail.

# Abnormal Bearing Noise

To find the source of abnormal bearing noise, we first look at the bearing itself, then the precision of the connected main shaft and housing, and finally other possible issues.

1. The bearing itself: When it comes to bearing noise, the first thing people think of is the quality of the bearing itself. This involves the choice of bearing brands. **Currently, our main choice is Wafangdian Bearing, while we also maintain cooperation with Harbin Bearing and Luoyang Bearing. If the price is acceptable, NSK and SKF are also options.**

2. Main shaft precision: If the bearing position tolerance on the main shaft is too small, the bearing will run on the inner circle; if it's too large, it will be too tight and may overheat. Both situations can lead to abnormal bearing noise. Our main shaft processing technology involves rough turning followed by precision grinding. **The tolerance is controlled from zero to plus one thousandth, and we conduct random inspections on the dimensions of each batch of main shafts.**

3. Housing precision: Substandard concentricity of the housing can cause noise. If the bearing position tolerance in the housing is too small, it can lead to overheating; if it's too large, the bearing will run on the outer circle. **To ensure the concentricity of the housing and the bearing position tolerance, all our housings are processed using horizontal machining centers.**

4. Unexpected issue - bearing rusting due to water ingress: **This is an epitome of our pursuit of high quality.**

The next section contains more content, but it's similar to a detective story case. So I'll try to narrate it in the form of a puzzle-solving exercise, hoping to add some interest to the reading.

## Case A

The event began with a questioning phone call from Customer A: "Have you become complacent now that your production has increased? Your products are getting worse!" After the returned bearing housing was disassembled, we immediately found that the middle part of the main shaft had obvious rust marks, and nearly one-third of the oil in the bearing housing was mixed with water. This water directly led to the rusting and seizing of the bearings, ultimately manifesting as abnormal noise, followed by a negative feedback mechanism of users scolding customers, and customers scolding us. At that time, we suspected that the user had improperly added water instead of oil, but then we were scolded again by Customer A: "We work with experienced electromechanical installation teams. Do you think they're rookies who would make such a basic mistake?" Since we couldn't think of more possibilities and it was an isolated incident, the matter was temporarily shelved.

## Case B

Some time later, Customer B reported that a fan that had been left outdoors for over a year without use made a noise "like an airplane taking off" when tested. Observing through the oil gauge of the bearing housing, the oil inside appeared yellowish, with white solids floating on the surface. It was speculated that water had entered again.

## Case C

Third time's a charm, Customer C also encountered a similar situation: outdoors, unused for over a year, bearing noise when started. As it was an engineering project, the fans had already been delivered to the site, but due to the long construction period, this issue arose just before acceptance. Nine out of ten fans were making noise... Well, another round of users scolding customers, and customers scolding us.

## Case D

Customer D, a major manufacturer of fiberglass fans, also reported that during recent maintenance, they found that the oil drained from several rooftop fans was mixed with water, although the bearings were not making abnormal noises.

As sales increased, this mysterious water ingress problem had developed to a point where it could no longer be ignored. So we were determined to solve this case!

First, we re-inquired with Customer A and confirmed that the fan in Case A was also used outdoors. Combining the first common point of all cases: **Outdoors!** Following the principle of "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth," **we concluded that "the source of water could only be rainwater."**

Now that we had found the source of water, the next step was to determine how it entered. Carefully observing the upper surface of the bearing housing, there was only one oil filling hole connected to the interior. At this point, a detail discovered during the disassembly of the returned product in Case A suddenly came to mind: **The middle part of the main shaft had obvious rust marks!** With this evidence, we could deduce the water entry path, although it seemed incredible: **"The water entered through the vent hole on the side of the oil filling screw."**

The structure of this screw is hollow, with a hole on the side acting as a vent. **If the fan is left outdoors for a long time without use, rainwater will slowly enter the bearing housing through this hole.** Over time, the amount of water becomes considerable! **After sunny days, with direct sunlight outdoors, the temperature rises, and the accumulated water inside the housing evaporates into steam, causing the bearings to rust.** Cases A, B, and C all fall into this category, while Case D demonstrates the importance of **regularly changing the oil**.


Case closed! Now it's time to summarize the experience and find countermeasures.

## Solution

Although the probability of occurrence is low, fans used outdoors for long periods face a safety risk of rainwater backflow into the bearing housing. To eliminate this risk, in addition to urging users to change oil regularly, **a more effective radical solution is to modify the structure of the oil filling screw to allow venting while preventing rain.** With this direction in mind, we started brainstorming: **To vent, there must be a passage, but to prevent rain, there can't be holes on the upper surface.** After much pondering, my experience as a fan salesman for several years gave me an inspiration: **Roof fans!**

**This is our designed "umbrella-shaped oil filling vent screw"**

With the concept sketch ready, the next step was implementation. Anyone can boast, but the key is to actually produce it:

This is the application diagram. How about that? We deliver on our promises, demonstrating our pursuit of quality.

# Water Leakage

When water-cooled bearing housings are connected to circulating water, there are generally three types of water leakage situations:

1. Internal cracks in the housing during casting, causing water and oil channels to interconnect, resulting in water spraying out from the oil filling hole.

2. External cracks in the housing during casting, causing water to spray directly from the cracks.

3. Housing cracking due to freezing in winter.

To avoid the first and second situations, **we have added a housing air tightness test process during semi-finished product processing. All semi-finished products are fully inspected, and defective products are eliminated.** As for the third situation, fan manufacturers can only remind users to drain the remaining water from the water channel through the drain port after shutting down in winter to prevent freezing at night.

# Oil Leakage

There are mainly two types of oil leakage situations in bearing housings:

1. External cracks in the housing during casting (mentioned above, addressed by the housing air tightness test).

2. Oil leaking from the contact area between the end covers and the main shaft.

To address this situation, first, to prevent oil seal wear due to friction between the main shaft and the oil seal, **all positions where our main shafts contact the end cover oil seals are polished, with tolerance set at zero.**

Then we focus on improving the end cover. Below is the structure diagram of our end cover:

Finally, there's the choice of oil seal material. The basic option is nitrile rubber, while the **high-end option is fluorine rubber.**

# Summary

We have mainly discussed common problems in the use of bearing housings, including abnormal bearing noise, water leakage, and oil leakage, and proposed corresponding preventive measures.

1. Abnormal bearing noise:

- Can be caused by bearing quality issues, main shaft precision, housing precision, or bearing rusting due to water ingress.
- To ensure bearing quality, we use brands such as Wafangdian, Harbin, and Luoyang Bearings, considering NSK and SKF when price allows.
- Main shaft and housing processing techniques are strictly controlled to ensure precision.
- Through case analysis, we found that bearing housings placed outdoors may rust and cause noise due to rainwater entering through the vent hole of the oil filling screw.
- Solutions include modifying the oil filling screw structure, designing an "umbrella-shaped oil filling vent screw" to prevent rainwater ingress.

2. Water leakage:

- Usually caused by internal or external cracks in the housing, or winter freezing.
- To prevent casting cracks, we added a housing air tightness test process to ensure the quality of all semi-finished products.
- For winter use, users are advised to drain residual water from the bearing housing to prevent freezing.

3. Oil leakage:

- May be caused by external housing cracks or wear of oil seals at the contact between end covers and main shaft.
- To prevent oil leakage, main shaft and end cover oil seal contact positions are polished, with strict tolerance control.
- End cover structure has been optimized, and different oil seal materials are used to improve sealing performance.

**These experiences and preventive measures are summarized from actual problems and lessons learned, aiming to improve the quality and reliability of our bearing housings, making us your trusted first choice.**
